# Current and 5-day WeatherApp
This application is meant to be used to search weather forecasts in big cities. You can search for any
city of your choice, or pick from the list of big cities located on the left hand side of the screen.

The application fetches information from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Api</a>.

You can find the finished application <a href="https://psiko23.github.io/Weather-App/">here</a>.

## Challenge

I challenged myself to do more DOM manipulation than I am really used to in learning how to effectively use APIs.
I feel as if I did a good job implementing what I know in vanilla JS to create a functional app.
